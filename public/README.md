# Public Directory

This directory contains static assets that are served directly by Next.js.

## File Structure Examples:
- `public/documents/` - For PDFs, documents
- `public/images/` - For images, logos
- `public/files/` - For other downloadable files

## Usage:
- Files in `public/` are accessible at the root URL
- Example: `public/documents/brochure.pdf` → `http://localhost:3000/documents/brochure.pdf`
- Example: `public/images/logo.png` → `http://localhost:3000/images/logo.png`

## Best Practices:
- Organize files in subdirectories by type
- Use descriptive filenames
- Keep file sizes reasonable for web delivery
