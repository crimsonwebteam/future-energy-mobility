          <p>If Users engage in conduct while using the Service that is in violation of the Policies or is otherwise illegal or improper, FUTURE MOBILITY reserves the right to suspend and/or terminate the Service or the User's access to the Service.

Users should maintain logs of dynamically assigned IP addresses.</p>
        </div>
